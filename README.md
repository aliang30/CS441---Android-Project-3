CS441 - Android Project 3

For the third android application, we were assigned to build a game that contains animation. I utilized Android Studio to develop a game that involves in you taking the role of the goalie. The objective of the game is quite clear and simple. You have to catch the soccer ball before it hits the net. There are two balls that move from the bottom to the top of the screen and all you have to do is to drag the glove to catch the balls. For the program, I also added a text blinking animation at the top of the screen that blinks for every 1 second with the use of a handler and text functions.

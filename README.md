Android Studio Application 
Project 3 Description (README)

For the third android application, we were assigned to build a game that contains animation. I utilized Android Studio to develop a game that involves you taking the role of the goalie. The objective of the game is quite clear and simple. You have to catch the soccer ball before it hits the net. Two balls move from the bottom to the top of the screen and all you have to do is to drag the glove (the goalie's hand) to catch the balls. For the program, I also added a text blinking animation on the top of the screen that blinks for every 1 second with the use of a handler and some text functions.

For every ball you miss, you will receive a message that says "Scored" (meaning the scorer scored) and if you successfully caught the ball, you will receive a message that says "Caught" on the bottom of the screen. The idea came from a 1979 Atari game called Asteroids. In Asteroids, you are given the mission to blast the asteroids to pieces with projectiles before the asteroid reaches you. It kind of gave me the idea and motivation to create a game that relates to that since the game I made involves having the player catch the ball before it reaches the net. On top of that, I love to play soccer.
